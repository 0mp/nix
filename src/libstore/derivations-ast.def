#We use DeriveWithOutState to create derivations that dont use state, and thus dont have the stateDerivationStateOutput and DerivationStateOutputDir in their derivation
#Ive put this in because eelco requested it, and its easy to stay backwards compatible, but ultimately I thinks that it should be removed to prevent confusion & duplication

#!!!!!!!!Change the string "DeriveWithOutState" in derivations.ast-def.cc to "Derive"
#TODO, make this automatic..
