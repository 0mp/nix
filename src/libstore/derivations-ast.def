#We use DeriveWithOutState to create derivations that dont use state, and thus dont have the stateDerivationStateOutput and DerivationStateOutputDir in their derivation
#Ive put this in because eelco requested it, and its easy to stay backwards compatible, but ultimately I think that it should be removed to prevent confusion & duplication
#The function will be called matchDerivateWithOutState, but it will match the Derive term to remain backwards compatible
